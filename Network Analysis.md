# Network analysis of citations:
The appeal documents often cite other court cases at multiple instances. During annotation phase, the cases cited in the context of Social Media were also recorded.  This information can be analyzed to understand which cases were most influential and whether any specific attributes contributed to those papers being cited more often.  

## Network Construction: 

We construct a graph network such that the nodes represent court cases and two court cases are connected by an edge if one court case cites the other one.  These edges have a direction as we know which case cites which one. A network constructed this way has a total of 125 nodes and 101 edges.  The network formed this way can be visualized as shown in figure 1. Note that the nodes have been positioned in a force directed layout so that there are as few crossing edges as possible.
