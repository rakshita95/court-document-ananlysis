# Introduction

In this report, I shall perform an exploratory analysis of the annotated court documents. The pupose of this analysis is to layout a framework for the type of insights that can be generated from this data. However, note that this analysis has only been conducted on a part of the document collection that was annotated. Tus, there is a sampling bias and the results should be noted in this context.

# Analysis
## Evidence Type and Platform 

Multiple social media instruments were used as evidence in the appeals documents that were analyzed. The figure shows that phototgraphs are the most common types of evidence used followed by posts and personal messages. Often, more than one of these instruments is used as evidence. For example, we see that posts, video and photographs were all used together in one of the cases.

In case of socila media platforms used, Facebook and Myspace are the most common platforms as seen in the figure below. Often times, evidence from more than one of these platforms was used. Facebook and Instagram, and Facebook and Twitter are some examples of platforms that were cited together in a case.

We can also go a step further and see which types of evidence is being used from which platform. On analyzing, we observe that photographs are mostly from Facebook, Myspace and Instagram accounts. Friend connections and posts on user's profile were also used from Facebook. It also interesting to note than cellphone messages and web emails were also used.  

## Offence

Next, we investigate to see which types of evidence ofr used for which types of offences. As we see in the table below, seexual assault and harassments cases mostly cited posts and messages whereas  murders mostly cited photograps. Photographs were also used as evidence for illegal possession of firearms.

## Language analysis

The rest of the columns like support, outcome etc. are free text attributed containing text exactly as described in the appeal document. Later, we demonstarte how complex tools like topic modellign can be used to uncover hidden themes in text. Despite that, we can still attempt to answer some simpler questions using other tools. For example, we can ask what words wer most commonly used when authenticating evidence in myspace vs space.
